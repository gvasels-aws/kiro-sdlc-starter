# Skills Directory

Skills are reusable capabilities that can be invoked automatically or manually during development.

## Available Skills

(This is a template project - skills can be added as needed)

Skills are more complex than simple agents and typically include:
- Multiple tool integrations
- Complex workflows
- State management
- Reusable components

## Creating Skills

To add a skill:
1. Create a directory: `.kiro/skills/{skill-name}/`
2. Add implementation files
3. Document the skill's capabilities
4. Configure skill invocation rules

## Example Skills

From the root kiro-starter-sdlc project:
- **code-reviewer**: Comprehensive code review with security and performance analysis
- **documentation-generator**: Generate API documentation and code documentation

## Usage

Skills are typically invoked automatically by the system when relevant patterns are detected, or can be explicitly called during workflows.
